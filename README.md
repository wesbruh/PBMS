<!-- SYNOPSIS -->
# About The Project 
The Photography Business Management System (PBMS) is a full-stack web platform built for our client, Bailey White of Your Roots Photography. The system streamlines the entire client experience by allowing users to create accounts, schedule photography sessions, submit inquiries, make secure payments, and access their final galleries. On the admin side, the platform provides an intuitive dashboard for managing clients, bookings, invoices, contracts, galleries, and notifications all in one place.

This project was developed as part of the Senior Capstone sequence (CSC 190/191) at California State University, Sacramento.

<!-- BACKGROUND  -->

# Background

Your Roots Photography is a modern photography brand based in Northern California that is dedicated to capturing real, emotional, and artistic imagery. With a focus on lifestyle, wedding, and maternity photography, the business combines a documentary approach with creative editing to produce stunning visuals that clients can treasure for years. The brand's mission is to create an effortless client experience, from booking to final gallery delivery completely. The business emphasizes professionalism, creativity, and strong client relationships. However, all of these tasks are being completed manually and by just one person. 

Our team recognized the need for a centralized, automated platform that would streamline these processes. 

* Client dashboard
* Automated invoice generation
* Online galleries
* Contract management
* Notifications and reminders
* Secure session tracking
